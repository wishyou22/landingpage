<h1>Refund Policy</h1>

<div className='refund-text'>

<div>Idur Academy maintains a strict policy regarding the cancellation and
     refund of subscribed packages. Once a user has subscribed to a package,
    cancellation is not permitted, and refunds are not issued under any circumstances.
    This policy is predicated on the unique nature of the offeringsâ€”non-tangible
    and irrevocable educational goods. By engaging with our services, customers
    acknowledge and accept the inherent characteristics of these goods, and it is their 
    responsibility to comprehend that no refund or cancellation option exists post-subscription.</div>
<div>

This policy is designed to ensure clarity and transparency in our 
transactions. We emphasize that customers need to carefully consider their 
subscription choices, as the commitment to a package is final and irreversible.
 We encourage users to thoroughly explore our offerings, features, and terms 
 before making a subscription decision.


</div>
<div>This approach aligns with our commitment to delivering high-quality 
    educational content and maintaining fairness in our business practices.
     While we understand that individual circumstances may vary, the
      non-negotiable stance on refunds and cancellations is a foundational 
      aspect of our service structure, aiming to provide a consistent and 
      equitable experience for all subscribers.
